            Web Application Development involves structuring the content in a 
            logical and progressive manner, covering key concepts and skills 
            necessary for developing web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course covers construction and design of dynamic web pages. The 
            emphasis lies on standardized HTML and CSS to create structure 
            and appearance. Validation of HTML and CSS code is done to verify 
            that syntax follows the selected standard. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The course also covers JavaScript to create dynamic behavior 
              on web sites. Various JavaScript libraries and their use as well 
              as how to retrieve data from external systems via APIs are also 
              included.

              In addition, the importance of ensuring that websites are accessible 
              to all users regardless of the functional variations and the 
              guidelines available to secure this is addressed. Also, how to

            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language 
            used to create the structure and content of web pages. It provides 
            tags and attributes that define the various elements on a web page, 
            such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, 
            and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, and it introduces new 
            features and improvements over its predecessors.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML5 also includes new elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, 
            &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, which help in 
            structuring the content more semantically.

            GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store, 
            manage and collaborate on their code. GitHub uses Git software, which 
            is a version control system that tracks and controls changes to the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this semester, we have been assigned to use GitHub and create 
            our own accounts as part of our coursework. Under the guidance of 
            our teacher, who recommended GitHub as an essential tool for developers, 
            we've delved deep into its features to enhance our understanding of version 
            control, collaboration, and project management. With our teacher's 
            unique style of teaching, he can keep track of our progress, review our 
            outputs, and provide valuable feedback to support our learning journey.

            Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based 
            on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on 
            September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. It is typically packaged in 
            a Linux distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linux is widely used in servers, mainframes, and supercomputers but 
            is also prevalent in personal computers, mobile devices, embedded 
            systems, and various other platforms. It's known for its stability, 
            security, and flexibility, and it's popular among developers and 
            system administrators due to its open-source nature, which allows 
            for extensive customization and modification.
