        <p>The Going Merry, initially known as the "Going Merry" before being 
          renamed by Usopp, was a pirate ship belonging to the Straw Hat Pirates. 
          It was a small but sturdy ship that played a vital role in the early 
          adventures of the crew.</p>
        <p>Throughout its journey, the Going Merry carried the Straw Hats through 
          various perilous situations, symbolizing their bond of friendship and the 
          spirit of adventure. From its construction in Syrup Village to its final 
          moments in the waters of Enies Lobby, the Going Merry will always be 
          remembered as an integral part of the crew's history.</p>
